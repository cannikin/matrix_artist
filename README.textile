h1. Matrix Artist

Matrix Artist is a simple web page that helps you in drawing images for the SparkFun RGB Matrix:

"http://www.sparkfun.com/products/760":http://www.sparkfun.com/products/760

You simply click to draw the image you want, then export the Arduino/Wiring code needed
to display your image on the matrix.

h2. Usage

You can download the index.html file and run it locally, or find it on my github page here. 

This easiest usage is to just click a spot to cycle through the default color palette 
(white, red, green, blue, yellow, teal, magenta, black).

When you're done, click the "Gimmie the Code" button and you'll be given the Arduino/Wiring code
needed to draw that one image. By default you get only the code necessary to define your colors
and an array representing your image. You can optionally include the wrapper code needed to actually
run the sketch from scratch.

h2. Coming Soon

* Create your own custom list of possible colors in the color palette
* Option to set your color as you click
* Keyboard modifiers - hold a key when clicking to use a specific color
